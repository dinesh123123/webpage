                        <h3>ELIGIBILITY:</h3>
                        <p>Subject to these Official Rules, the Contest is open to individual persons who are at least 18 years old as of the date of entry. To be eligible to receive a Prize (as defined below), the information associated with the entrant’s account must be true and accurate. The information associated with the entrant’s account must identify the actual entrant into the Contest. Certain Contests are only open to residents of specific countries. Any person that enters into a Contest that he/she is not eligible to enter may not win a Prize (as defined below) in that Contest.</p>
                        <p>Employees, agents, and contractors (collectively, "employees") of Sponsor and its respective parents, affiliates, subsidiaries, and advertising and promotion agencies and any other entity involved in the development or administration of this Contest, and all persons residing in the same households as employees, including but not limited to immediate family members are not eligible to win the Contest while the employee is employed or engaged by Sponsor and for six months following the employee’s last day working with or for Sponsor.</p>
                        <p>Entrants may, in certain circumstances, communicate with, work with, or otherwise benefit from others with whom they have a preexisting relationship while participating in a Contest. However, entrants may not communicate with, work with, or otherwise benefit from more than 25 other persons while entering a Contest if the communications between the entrant and those persons is facilitated by any technological means other than those explicitly provided by Sponsor.</p>
                        <p>Lamba reserves the right to verify an entrant’s eligibility before, during, or after the Contest.</p>
                        <p>Notice to all international entrants: As stated above, it is your responsibility to comply with the contest laws of your country/jurisdiction. You acknowledge that certain countries/jurisdictions have laws regarding Contests that may prevent Sponsor from awarding you your Prize (as defined below). If you are a winner and this happens to be the case with your country/jurisdiction, you acknowledge that you may not be able to receive any Prize at all from Sponsor. By entering this Contest, you acknowledge the risks, and understand that you may win, but not be able to receive a Prize.</p>
                        <h4>ENTRY PERIOD:</h4>
                        <p>Episodes of the Contest will be announced through the App from time to time. You may join the Contest while it is live. Sponsor reserves the right to cancel Contests, in our sole discretion, without any restrictions.</p>

                        <h4>PRIZES</h4>
                        <p>The winner of each live trivia game show match will receive a cash prize, determined in Sponsor’s sole discretion (the "Prize"). In the case of multiple winners (as explained below), such players will split the Prize evenly. The total of all accrued Prizes you have win may be viewed through your Lamba account. To receive payment of your accrued Prizes, you must cash-out Prizes via bank transfer, or a third party service specified on the App. Prize fulfillment will be subject to the terms, conditions, and privacy policies of the bank or third party. In certain instances involving larger Prizes, at Lamba's sole discretion, you will be contacted directly to receive it by a mutually agreeable method and payment will be subject to a confirmation of the winner's eligibility to receive a Prize consistent with Sponsor's Rules and Terms of Use.</p>
                        <p>You must comply with the Rules of Conduct contained in Lamba's Terms of Use. Any entry by any user that does not comply with the Rules of Conduct, the Terms of Use, or these Contest Rules will be disqualified.</p>
                        <p>Each Lamba user may establish, maintain, use and control only one account. Each account may only be owned, maintained, used and controlled by one individual. For avoidance of doubt, users may not "co-own" accounts. In the event Sponsor determines that you have opened, maintained, used or controlled more than one account, in addition to any other rights that Sponsor may have, Sponsor reserves the right to suspend or terminate any or all of your accounts and terminate, withhold or revoke the awarding of any Prizes.</p>
                    
                        <p>Each Lamba account can only be associated with one bank account. And a bank account cannot be associated with more than one Lamba account. Attempts to associate a Lamba account with additional third-party accounts may result in the termination of that Lamba account and forfeiture of any Prizes awarded.</p>
                        <p>Lamba will only issue a Prize and any accompanying tax forms to the individual identified in the account information for the winning account. Lamba uses your account information to contact and verify winners. Out of date or incorrect account information at the time you enter a Contest may disqualify you from receiving a Prize. Failure to provide valid, working contact information in connection with your account may result in termination of that Lamba account and forfeiture of any Prizes awarded.</p>
                        <p>Sponsor expressly reserves the right to disqualify any entries that it believes in good faith are generated by an automated means or scripts or that violate any of these Contest Rules or the Terms of Use. Entries generated by script, macro or other automated means are void.</p>
                        <p>Decisions of the Sponsor are final and binding with respect to all matters related to the Contest. In no event shall the Sponsor be obligated to award any Prizes other than the Prize specified in these Official Rules. The Sponsor does not guarantee that the Prize can be made available to the winner. The Prize is not assignable and not transferable and no substitutions are permitted. In addition, if the Prize is unable to be fulfilled to the winner due to any applicable law, rule or regulation, or if the winner cannot claim the Prize for any reason, then Sponsor reserves the right to not award the Prize at all. The winner shall be responsible and liable for all federal, state and local taxes on the value of the Prize. Winners shall provide Lamba with accurate information regarding their identity and country of residence. </p>
                        <h4>PRIZE SELECTION</h4>
                        <p>The winner of the Contest will be the last person remaining at the end of each game show match. If there are multiple players remaining after the final question, such remaining players will split the Prize evenly. Sponsor may also offer "The 1" Contests. In "The 1" Contests, which shall be clearly identified at the outset of the game show in which the Contest is offered, players will continue to receive questions until only a single player is able to correctly answer the question given. Sponsor will then award the Prize to the single remaining player. If all remaining players fail to answer a question correctly, resulting in every player's elimination, the Prize for "The 1" Contest will roll over to a future game, which will be announced live at the conclusion of the game.</p>
                        <p>The Contest will be conducted under the supervision of the Sponsor. The decisions of the Sponsor are final and binding in all matters relating to this Contest. The winner will be notified in the Lamba Application or by email; provided, however, that Sponsor reserves the right to determine an alternate method of notification. The winner must cash-out the Prize within 90 days after the date of notification of such Prize. A Contest winner's failure to cash-out the Prize within the specified 90 days will be considered such Contest winner's forfeiture of the Prize and Sponsor may, at its option and sole discretion, choose not to award the Prize at all. If an entrant is found to be ineligible, Sponsor may, at its option and sole discretion, choose not to award the Prize at all.</p>
                        <h4>GENERAL CONDITIONS AND RELEASES:</h4>
                        <p>Notice to all international entrants: As stated above, it is your responsibility to comply with the contest laws of your country/jurisdiction. You acknowledge that certain countries/jurisdictions have laws regarding Contests that may prevent Sponsor from awarding you your Prize (as defined below).

                        <p>An entrant or winner may be disqualified from the Contest if he or she fails to comply with any provision of these Official Rules or the Sponsor’s Terms of Use, as determined in the sole discretion of the </p>
                        <p>Sponsor. Sponsor, in its sole discretion, may disqualify you from a Contest, refuse to award Prizes and require the return of any Prizes, or suspend, limit, or terminate your account if you engage in conduct Sponsor deems, in its sole discretion, to be improper, unfair, fraudulent or otherwise adverse to the operation of Contests or in any way detrimental to other users. Improper conduct includes, but is not limited to: Falsifying personal information, including payment information, required to claim a Prize; violating eligible payment method terms, including the terms of any cash rewards payment card, violating any of these Rules, using unauthorized methods such as unauthorized scripts or other automated means; tampering with the administration of the Contest or trying to in any way tamper with the computer programs associated with the Contests; obtaining other entrants’ information and spamming other entrants; and any other form of abuse; or otherwise violating these Rules. You acknowledge that the forfeiture and/or return of any Prize shall in no way prevent Sponsor from informing the relevant authorities, and/or pursuing criminal or civil proceedings in connection with such conduct.</p>
                        <p>Participation in the Contest is at entrant’s own risk. Sponsor shall not be liable for: (1) failed, returned or misdirected notifications based on inaccurate information provided by the winner in connection with an entry; (2) entries and responses to winner notifications which are lost, late, incomplete, illegible, unintelligible, postage-due, misdirected, damaged or otherwise not received by the intended recipient in whole or in part or for computer or technical error of any kind; (3) any electronic miscommunications or failures, technical hardware or software failures of any kind, lost or unavailable network connections, or failed incomplete, garbled or delayed computer transmissions which may limit an entrant's ability to participate in the Contest; (4) any technical malfunctions of the telephone network, computer on-line system, computer equipment, software, program malfunctions or other failures, delayed computer transactions or network connections that are human, mechanical or technical in nature, or any combination thereof, including any injury or damage to entrant's or any other person's computer or mobile device related to or resulting from downloading the App or otherwise in connection with this Contest; or (5) any warranty with respect to any Prize or any component thereof.</p>
                        <h5>THE CONTEST IS PROVIDED "AS IS" AND SPONSOR DOES NOT MAKE ANY, AND HEREBY DISCLAIMS ANY AND ALL, REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND REGARDING THE CONTEST.</h5>
                        <p>NOTWITHSTANDING ANYTHING ELSE HEREIN OR OTHERWISE, SPONSOR SHALL NOT BE LIABLE OR OBLIGATED WITH RESPECT TO ANY SUBJECT MATTER OF THIS AGREEMENT OR UNDER CONTRACT, NEGLIGENCE, STRICT LIABILITY OR OTHER LEGAL OR EQUITABLE THEORY FOR (A) ANY SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES (INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, LOSS OF REVENUE, GOODWILL, OR ANTICIPATED PROFITS) (B) AMOUNTS IN EXCESS OF THE PRIZE FOR THE APPLICABLE CONTEST, (C) DATA LOSS OR COST OF PROCUREMENT OF SUBSTITUTE GOODS OR SERVICES, AND/OR (D) ANY MATTER BEYOND SUCH PARTIES’ REASONABLE CONTROL.</p>
                        <p>By entering the Contest, you agree to and hereby do release and hold harmless Sponsor, its respective parents, subsidiaries and affiliated entities, directors, officers, employees, attorneys, agents, and representatives (the "Released Parties") from any damage, injury, death, loss, claim, action, demand, or other liability (collectively, “Claims”) that may arise from your acceptance, possession and/or use of any Prize or your participation in this Contest, or from any misuse or malfunction of any Prize awarded, regardless of whether such Claims, or knowledge of the facts constituting such Claims, exist at the time of entry or arise at any time thereafter, and indemnify each of the Released Parties from any damages arising therefrom. Any person attempting to defraud or in any way tamper with this Contest may be prosecuted to the full extent of the law. Sponsor reserves the right to modify these Official Rules in any way or at any time. Sponsor reserves the right, in its sole discretion, to cancel or suspend this Contest should viruses, bugs or other causes beyond its control corrupt the administration, security or proper operation of the Contest. In the event of cancellation or suspension, Lamba shall promptly post a notice on the Lamba App to such effect. This Contest shall be governed in accordance with the laws of Nigeria and any disputes arising out of or in connection with these Terms of Use shall be subject to exclusive jurisdiction of courts in Nigeria. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Sponsor may seek equitable relief in any court of competent jurisdiction. If any provision of these Rules is held to be illegal or unenforceable, such provision shall be limited or eliminated to the minimum extent necessary so that these Rules otherwise remain in full force and effect and enforceable.</p>
